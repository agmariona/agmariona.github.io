I am a PhD student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science at MIT, where I am member of the [Network Coding and Reliable
Communications Group](https://www.rle.mit.edu/ncrcg/){:target="\_blank"}. I am
advised by [Prof. Muriel
MÃ©dard](https://www.rle.mit.edu/ncrcg/muriel-medard/){:target="\_blank"}.

I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from Harvard University, where I had
the pleasure of working with [Prof. Flavio du Pin
Calmon](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/){:target="\_blank"} on data set
compression.

I worked at Bose as an electrical engineering intern in the consumer
electronics division of Applied Research.
